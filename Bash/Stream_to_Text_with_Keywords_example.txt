Battlestar Galactica - Best scene - Bill Adama vs Saul Tigh

   "i don't care that it's effective i don't care that the silence can't stop it it's wrong"
   "no more suicide bombings colonel"
   "you understand what are you working for the cylons now"

   "i'm sorry it's no skin"
   "is he little things like that they don't matter anymore that not do frog and maturity matters anymore i had one job here lady and one job only to destruct the cylons make them worry about the and ale leaves stirred up down here so they're distracted and out of position"
   "when the old man shows up in orbit the bombings they've got the silent attention they really got their attention and i am not given that up"
   "we are talking about people blowing themselves up"
   "you know"
   "sometimes i think that you get ice water in those veins and other times i think you're just a naive little schoolteacher"
   "i said man on suicide missions in two wars now and let me tell you something you don't make a goddamn bit of difference whether they're riding in a viper or walking out onto a parade ground in the end they're just as dead"
   "so take your piety and your moralizing and your high minded principles and stick em someplace safe until you're off this rock and you're sitting in your nice cushy chair on colonial one again"
   "i've got a war to fight"
